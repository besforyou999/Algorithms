		Linear search

 Linear search, also known as sequential search is a method for finding an element
within a list(or array). It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
 Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, have more faster searching speed.

1. linear_search1.c

 Basic implementation of algorithm linear search


2. Sentinel method(Sentinel Value)

 Linear search does two tests at each loop

 	1)whether the value has been found in array
	2)whether the end of array has been reached

Sentinel method can make the search do one test at each loop, which makes the search more efficient. 
  

	



		Binary search

 To use this algorithm, data must be sorted before applying.
Faster than linear search.

Lets think about finding number 39 in this array called 'a' sorted in ascending order.

	5		7		15		28		29		31		39		58		68		70		97
	a[0]	a[1]	a[2]	a[3]	a[4]	a[5]	a[6]	a[7]	a[8]	a[9]	a[10]

We can know that number 39 is bigger than 31, the element placed at the middle of the array.Then we can also know 39 is somewhere at a[6]~a[10]. Then check if a[8] is the number trying to search. a[8] is 68, which is bigger than 39. So we can know 39 is somewhere between a[6]~a[7]. Know we can find 39 by checking the last two numbers.

This algorithm makes searching numbers in array much more faster than linear search.
