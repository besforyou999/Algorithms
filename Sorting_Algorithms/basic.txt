Lining data in a specific order.
Sorting makes easier to search data




	- Stability of Sorting Algorithm

After sorting, if elements with the same value are lined as same as before sorted, the algorithm can be called a Stable sorting algorithm. If not it can be called an unstable sorting algorith.





	- Internal sorting, external sorting

If a sorting algorithm can be executed in one array, it is called internal sorting
If there is too many data hard enough to sort in one array, the algorithm is called external sorting.



	- Sorting methods


1. Bubble sort( sometimes refered to as sinking sort )

 Repeats comparing and exchanging with adjacent elements until sorting is complete.

ex)
// int a[] : array to sort, int n: length of array
void sort(int a[], int n){
		
	int i,j;

	for(i = 0 ; i < n-1; i++) {
		for(j = n-1 ; j > i ; j-- ) {
			if( a[j-1] > a[j] )
				swap( a[j-1], a[j] );
		}
	}
	
}



2. Straight selection sort

 Selects the smallest element and insert the element to an appropriate position
 until sorting is complete.

 	Simply said,
		
		1) Find the smallest element from the field that are not sorted yet
		2) Exchange the found smallest element with the first element of the field that is n		   ot yet sorted
		3) Repeat until sorting is complete


 Straight selection sort is an Unstable algorithm.

 Straight selection sort algorithm changes elements (n2 -n)/2 times in average.
 n is the number of elements in an array. n2 is square of 2
